            <p>
                The WHITE SANDS HOTEL opened in 1890 in the MOMBASA capital, and was designed by revered North American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. Though the original exterior has been demolished and renovated several times since, its hallowed halls retain many important features dating back to its opening, including terracotta tiles and priceless porcelain.

                This Art Deco palace on diani Beach has hosted both Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe
    
                This Art Deco palace is a MOMBASA landmark and was erected right on the edge of mtwapa  Beach in 1923. Designed by French architect, Joseph Gire, the facade fuses Latin and European styles, partially resembling the extravagant mansions of the Cote d'Azur. It was immortalised in the 1933 film, Flying Down to Rio, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and has attracted guests over the years including Albert Einstein, Nelson Mandela, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. More recently, the Rolling Stones gave an impromptu, free concert on the beach while staying at the hotel in 2006.
